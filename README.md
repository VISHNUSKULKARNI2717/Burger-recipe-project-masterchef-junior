Boil carrots, cauliflower, green peas and French beans. Cool and then mince finely.
Step 2
Add mashed potatoes, ginger, green chillies and salt and mix well. Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape each portion into a round pattie.
Step 3
Make a thick batter by mixing refined flour and water. Dip each pattie in the batter and then coat with breadcrumbs.
Step 4
Heat sufficient oil in a deep pan and deep fry the patties on medium heat until golden brown. Drain and place them on an absorbent paper.
Step 5
Cut bread buns into half (horizontally). Keep in a salamander until a little crisp.
Step 6
Apply butter, put the vegetable burger in between the bread buns, top with a slice of onion, tomato and cucumber and serve immediately.
